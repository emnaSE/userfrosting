## [Unreleased]

## [3.0.0] - 2019-03-12

This release focuses on simplifying the package for UserFrosting 4 to improve maintainability. Features unsupported by UF4 are largely removed.

### Added
- Raw configuration validation.
- Raw configuration merging with collision logic (ported from UserFrosting `gulpfile`).
- Path transformation with support for file replacement based on rule order (later rules superseed earlier ones).
- Ability to specify base path for resolution of bundle resources and path transformations.
- Support for comprehensive logging through a passed logger function.

### Changed
- Functionality offered by results file has been replaced by `ResultsMap` property.
- Reads stream chunks (`Vinyl` instances) instead of directly from file system.
- As an internal `gulp` pipeline is no longer responsible for bundle generation, custom `Transform` streams (e.g. `gulp-concat-css`) must be provided.
- Path transformations will no longer be applied to files due to complexity around how paths are managed in `gulp`. Instead this feature will be used for override logic alone.
- Bundle results are now retrieved via a callback which is given a collection of `Vinyl` `NullFiles` to retain as much useful information as possible.
- Moved package under `@userfrosting` organisation in NPM and removed superfluous `uf` from package name.

### Removed
- Support for CSS sourcemaps (broken since 2.27.2).
- Specification of pre-minified files (`minSrc`).
- CoffeeScript, and LESS compilation (functionality can be implemented manually through provided `Bundlers`).
- Glob paths.
- Environment based build conditions (functionality can be implemented manually through provided `Bundlers`).
- Incremental/watched builds.
- Automatic HTML tag generation for results file (use results callback to implement this manually).
- File copy support (use `gulp.dest` or an equivalent).
- Result file support (replaced by callback).
- Removed dependency on `gulp` as per best practises.
